A collection of libraries, a pipeline plugin, and a CDAP service for performing data
cleansing, transformation, and filtering using a set of data manipulation instructions
(directives). These instructions are either generated using an interative visual tool or
are manually created.

  * Data Prep defines few concepts that might be useful if you are just getting started with it. Learn about them [here](wrangler-docs/concepts.md)
  * The Data Prep Transform is [separately documented](wrangler-transform/wrangler-docs/data-prep-transform.md).
  * [Data Prep Cheatsheet](wrangler-docs/cheatsheet.md)

## Feature Enhancements

More [here](wrangler-docs/upcoming-features.md) on upcoming features.

  * **User Defined Directives, also known as UDD**, allow you to create custom functions to transform records within CDAP DataPrep or a.k.a Wrangler. CDAP comes with a comprehensive library of functions. There are however some omissions, and some specific cases for which UDDs are the solution. Additional information on how you can build your custom directives [here](wrangler-docs/custom-directive.md).
    * Migrating directives from version 1.0 to version 2.0 [here](wrangler-docs/directive-migration.md)
    * Information about Grammar [here](wrangler-docs/grammar/grammar-info.md)
    * Various `TokenType` supported by system [here](../api/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/TokenType.java)
    * Custom Directive Implementation Internals [here](wrangler-docs/udd-internal.md)

  * A new capability that allows CDAP Administrators to **restrict the directives** that are accessible to their users.
More information on configuring can be found [here](wrangler-docs/exclusion-and-aliasing.md)

  * **Byte Size and Time Duration Parsing:** Wrangler core has been enhanced to understand common byte size and time duration units within directive arguments when using positional argument syntax.
      *   **Byte Sizes:** Values like `"10KB"`, `"1.5MB"`, `"512b"`, `"2GiB"` can now be parsed directly by directives expecting a byte size argument positionally. The units (B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB - case-insensitive) are automatically converted to a canonical byte value (long). Note: Uses 1024-based units (KiB, MiB, etc.).
      *   **Time Durations:** Values like `"500ms"`, `"2.5s"`, `"100us"`, `"2h"`, `"3min"` can be parsed directly by directives expecting a time duration argument positionally. The units (ns, us, ms, s, min, h - case-insensitive) are automatically converted to a canonical nanosecond value (long).

## Directive Details
Calculates aggregate statistics for byte size and time duration columns across all input rows.

**Syntax:**

## `aggregate-stats` Directive

```wrangler
aggregate-stats <size-column> <time-column> <total-bytes-column> <avg-nanos-column>;

## `aggregate-stats` Directive

The `aggregate-stats` directive aggregates byte size and time duration values from input columns and outputs a single row with summary statistics.

### **Arguments**

- `<size-column>` (`ColumnName`):  
  The input column containing byte size values (e.g., `"10KB"`, `"1.5MB"`).  
  ⚠️ **Note**: Use simple or generic column names (e.g., `:data`, `:col1`) rather than names like `:size` due to parser limitations.

- `<time-column>` (`ColumnName`):  
  The input column containing time duration values (e.g., `"500ms"`, `"2.5s"`).  
  ⚠️ **Note**: Same naming recommendations as `<size-column>`.

- `<total-bytes-column>` (`ColumnName`):  
  The name of the output column that will contain the **sum of all valid byte sizes**, represented as a `Long` (total bytes).

- `<avg-nanos-column>` (`ColumnName`):  
  The name of the output column that will contain the **average of all valid time durations**, represented as a `Double` (average nanoseconds).

---

### **Output**

A single row containing:
- The specified target columns:
  - `total-bytes-column` (`Long`)
  - `avg-nanos-column` (`Double`)
- `aggregate_count` (`Long`): total number of input rows processed

⚠️ Rows with `null` or unparseable values in the source columns are **skipped** for the respective aggregation **but included** in the overall count.

---

### **Example**

Assume input rows have columns `bytes_in` (e.g., `"1MB"`) and `latency` (e.g., `"150ms"`):

```wrangler
aggregate-stats :bytes_in :latency :total_transfer_bytes :average_latency_ns;
